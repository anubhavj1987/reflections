what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize repo, it adds hidden file ".git" to current directory that keeps track of commit history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is intermediate step that keeps record of added files to commit later.
It offers to commit specific set of files rather they commiting everything.
