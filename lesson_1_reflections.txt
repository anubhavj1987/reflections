How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

diff will highlight lines where diffrence occured and we can find out mistake or error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By checking history we can learn past implementations and mistakes quickly that can help us in updating codes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual commits allow us to divide different commits on basis on logical changes each time. Automated savings may results in huge history data with irrelevant saving instances.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will tell us all commits starting from latest with messages. 
git diff will tell us difference between two versions of commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

We can program confidently becuase in case of bugs we can always checkout to previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try using git for coding.
